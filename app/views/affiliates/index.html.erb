	<h2>Creating Links</h2>
	<p>Add <code>?ref=<%= @affiliate.affiliate_id %></code> to the end of any link on the <code>tools.joebuhlig.com</code> url.</p>
	<p>Examples:</p>
	<p><code>http://tools.joebuhlig.com/?ref=<%= @affiliate.affiliate_id %></code></p>
	<p><code>http://tools.joebuhlig.com/working-with-omnifocus/?ref=<%= @affiliate.affiliate_id %></code></p>
	<h2>Payments</h2>
	<p>I will send a payment to your email via PayPal at the beginning of each month. The program currently pays 20% of the final purchase price on each product, so you'll receive 20% after all promotions and discounts have been applied.</p>
	<h2>Stats</h2>
	<p>I'm still building this portion of the site. It should be up and running before your first payment.</p>

	<h2>How it works</h2>
	<div class="affiliate-instructions">
		<h3>1. <%= link_to "Sign Up", new_user_registration_path %></h3>
		<p>Create an account to recieve your affiliate link and see your stats.</p>
		<h3>2. Share</h3>
		<p>Share your link anywhere. If you've found these tools useful, introduce other folks to them and get paid when they use your link to make a purchase.</p>
		<h3>3. Get Paid</h3>
		<p>Once a month you will be paid 20% of the purchase price of each item bought using your link. (Percentage will apply to the purchase price after promotions and discounts.)</p>
